## Box 1: ICANN’s Initiatives to Enhance DNS Security

**ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)** plays a central role in managing and securing the DNS globally. Over the years, ICANN has initiated several key efforts to bolster DNS security, including:

1. **Promoting DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**: ICANN has been instrumental in promoting the adoption of DNSSEC, which adds cryptographic signatures to DNS responses to ensure data integrity and protect against attacks like cache poisoning.
2. **Root Zone Management**: ICANN plays a key role in managing the root zone of the DNS, ensuring its security and availability through secure operations and coordination with root server operators.
3. **Security Collaboration**: ICANN collaborates with stakeholders like TLD registries, domain name registrars, and governments to promote best practices and secure DNS infrastructure.
4. **Capacity Building and Training**: ICANN organizes capacity-building workshops to raise awareness and improve technical expertise across different regions, helping local actors secure their DNS operations.

ICANN’s leadership and multi-stakeholder engagement are pivotal in driving global DNS security initiatives.

## Box 2: DNSSEC in Sweden: A Success Driven by the Multi-Stakeholder Community

**Sweden** serves as a prime example of successful DNSSEC implementation, largely driven by its **multi-stakeholder approach**. Key factors in Sweden’s DNSSEC success include:

1. **Collaborative Efforts**: A wide range of stakeholders, including the **Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS)**, domain registrars, ISPs, and the technical community, worked together to support DNSSEC adoption.
2. **Early Adoption**: Sweden was one of the first countries to implement DNSSEC in its national **.se** domain, setting an example for other countries.
3. **Public-Private Partnerships**: Cooperation between government authorities and private sector companies facilitated the smooth implementation of DNSSEC.
4. **Outreach and Training**: Stakeholders invested in training and awareness programs to help ISPs, domain owners, and users understand the benefits of DNSSEC.

Sweden’s experience shows that successful DNSSEC deployment requires a strong **multi-stakeholder commitment** and coordination across different sectors.

## Box 3: “Have I Been Pwned?”: The Importance of Awareness-Raising for Credentials Compromise

**"Have I Been Pwned?"** is a popular online tool created by **Troy Hunt** that allows users to check whether their credentials have been compromised in a data breach. This tool highlights the importance of **awareness-raising** in the context of credentials compromise and DNS abuse.

- **Credential Compromise**: Users can input their email addresses to see if their credentials have been leaked in any of the numerous data breaches tracked by the service.
- **Preventing Abuse**: By making users aware of their compromised credentials, the platform encourages them to take proactive measures, such as changing passwords or enabling two-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Public Trust**: Tools like "Have I Been Pwned?" contribute to a broader understanding of the risks of credential abuse, helping to protect both individual users and organizations from DNS-related attacks (e.g., domain hijacking).

Raising awareness about the risks of compromised credentials is crucial for preventing further exploitation and abuse within the DNS ecosystem.

## Box 4: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** is a voluntary framework developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** to help organizations manage cybersecurity risk. Key components of the framework include:

1. **Core Functions**: The framework is built around five core functions—**Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**—which provide a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risk.
2. **Tiers and Profiles**: The framework helps organizations evaluate their current cybersecurity posture using four tiers of maturity and develop a **profile** to align cybersecurity efforts with business needs.
3. **Best Practices**: The NIST framework offers best practices and guidelines for improving cybersecurity in areas such as network protection, incident response, and system recovery.

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is widely adopted across industries and governments as a **standard for improving cybersecurity posture**.

## Box 5: The DNS Abuse Institute

The **DNS Abuse Institute** was established to provide resources, tools, and best practices to combat **DNS abuse**. Key activities of the institute include:

1. **Education and Awareness**: The institute runs programs to educate registries, registrars, and end-users on how to detect and prevent DNS abuse.
2. **Tool Development**: The institute develops and promotes tools to help combat DNS abuse, such as malware, phishing, and domain name hijacking.
3. **Collaboration**: The DNS Abuse Institute collaborates with a wide range of stakeholders, including law enforcement, policymakers, and the cybersecurity community, to coordinate efforts in tackling DNS abuse.
4. **Research and Policy Advocacy**: By conducting research and advocating for improved policies and regulations, the institute aims to reduce DNS abuse and increase the overall security of the DNS ecosystem.

The **DNS Abuse Institute** plays a critical role in building a **safer and more secure Internet**, focusing on combating DNS-related threats.

## Conclusion

These initiatives, frameworks, and tools, as outlined in the boxes from the DNS security document, illustrate how multi-stakeholder efforts, frameworks like NIST, and awareness programs like "Have I Been Pwned?" are instrumental in improving DNS security and preventing abuse. From global initiatives like ICANN’s leadership to localized successes like Sweden’s DNSSEC adoption, these examples highlight the importance of collaboration, education, and proactive defense in securing the DNS.
